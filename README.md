Lime Turbobutton

Small utility to activate internet boost to 100Mbit/s for Moscow's ISP OnLime.

Now it's just archive, OnLime was rebranded to Rostelecom, old tariff plans under 100Mbit/s no longer used by anyone, rules of reward program was completely changed.

You can read more about that utility history on [official forum's thread](https://forum.onlime.ru/index.php?/topic/12307-турбокнока-приложение-для-windowslinux/), ISP claims whole forum will be abandoned, but for now (20.05.2021) it's still accessible.
