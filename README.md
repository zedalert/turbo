### Lime Turbobutton

Small application to activate internet boost service to 100Mbit/s for Moscow's ISP OnLime.

Now it's just an archive, OnLime was rebranded to Rostelecom, old tariff plans under 100Mbit/s are no longer used by anyone, and the rules of the reward program were completely changed.

You can read more about that application history on [official forum's thread](https://forum.onlime.ru/index.php?/topic/12307-турбокнока-приложение-для-windowslinux/), ISP claims the whole forum will be abandoned, but for now (14.11.2021) it's still accessible.
